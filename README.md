## Minimax Algorithm in Tic-Tac-Toe

The program uses [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) within a tic-tac-toe game. The program when compiled, will generate a game of tic-tac-toe in the terminal. The program essentially minimizes loss to at best win the game and at worst tie. Since a game of tic-tac-toe has a determined amount of moves, we can optimize the game within a binary search tree and maximize or minimize the outcome of each turn--depending on turn.
