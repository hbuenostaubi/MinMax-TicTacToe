## Minimax Algorithm in Tic-Tac-Toe

The program uses [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) within a tic-tac-toe game. The program when compiled, will generate a game of tic-tac-toe in the terminal. The program essentially minimizes loss to at best win the game and at worst tie. Since a game of tic-tac-toe has a determined amount of moves, we can optimize the game within a search tree and maximize or minimize the outcome of each move--depending on turn. When we're on the defensive, we minimize loss and, on the offensive, maximize win. 

Tic-Tac-Toe is not like Chess, were there is almost an infinite amount of moves...so this algorithm applies at maximizing wins. Good luck defeating the algorithm!
